# Loan Eligibility Prediction using Naive-Bayes
Loan eligibility prediction problem is a clean classification problem as we need to classify whether the loan-status is Yes or No. For this project, I collected train and test data from Kaggle. I explored the data with pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn, make predictions with scikit-learn and eveluated using Decision Tree Classifier and Naive-Bayes. And found that Naive-Bayes performs better than Decision Tree Classifier in this dataset. Then I predicted the values with new dataset.
